    </header>

      <p>I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.<br>
        If your guess is more than 10 away from my number, I'll tell you you're COLD.<br>
        If your guess is within 10 of my number, I'll tell you you're HOT.<br>
        If your guess is farther than your most recent guess, I'll say you're getting COLDER.<br>
        If your guess is closer than your most recent guess, I'll say you're getting HOTTER.<br>
        <strong>LET'S PLAY!</strong></p>

        <label for='inputNumber' class="alertBox" id="alertBox">What is your guess?</label><br>
        <input id="inputNumber" type="text" value="" placeholder="Enter a Number"><br>
        <input type="submit" id="choose" value="Submit">
        <input type="submit" id="restart" value="Restart">
